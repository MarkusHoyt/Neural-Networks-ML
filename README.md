# Neural-networks-ML

The main purpose of this project is to work through the full lifecycle of a applied machine learning project. the project is divided into three general components: 1) Analytic Plan, 2) Preliminary Results, and 3) Final Report.

In the applied industry context, the Final Report would be the final client deliverable, where a data scientist presents the earlier reviewed, and amended, if necessary, results and recommendations, all presented in the context of the key elements of the Analytic Plan, emphasizing the stated goal(s) of the project. As such, the Final Report is characterized by greater scope (than the Analytic Plan and Preliminary Results assignments) as it needs to address the key elements of both the Analytic Plan and Preliminary Results, in addition to also delineating the key takeaways and recommendations.
